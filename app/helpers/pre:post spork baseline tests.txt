# Before running Spork, we can get a baseline for the testing overhead by timing our test suite as follows:

Randys-MacBook-Air:sample_app admin$ time bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb
.........

Finished in 0.29909 seconds
9 examples, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 27835


real	0m8.399s
user	0m7.564s
sys	  0m0.760s

# now run our test suite with the --drb (“distributed Ruby”) option and verify that the environment-loading overhead is greatly reduced:

Randys-MacBook-Air:sample_app admin$ time bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb --drb
.........

Finished in 0.39789 seconds   # the times below are faster, but the "Finished in 0.xxxxxx seconds" is longer!
